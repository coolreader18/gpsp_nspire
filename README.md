# gpsp_nspire

This is a project to modernize/update gpSP-Nspire as much as possible and/or to
the best of my ability. The majority of the code that's here is written by
calc84maniac, tangrs, Exophase, and notaz, which includes the original gpSP gba
emulator source code (by Exophase and notaz), the elf loader (by tangrs), and
the original port (by calc84maniac). This code was all originally released by
calc84maniac
[here](<https://www.omnimaga.org/ti-nspire-projects/gpsp-nspire-(gba-emulator)/msg314055/#msg314055>).
